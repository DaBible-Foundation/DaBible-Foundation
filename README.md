# DaBible Foundation Project Management, made simple

At DaBible Foundation, project managers, developers, designers, analysts, writers, and volunteers, come together here to coordinate, track, and update our work in one place, so projects stay transparent and on schedule.

All the members of the DaBible Foundation are simply a group of young youths. We run an open-source organization which means, everyone can contribute! Yes, what you just read is correct, *YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE!*.

We currently have two mobile apps, Yoruba Audio Bible, and Pidgin Audio Bible,  which are available on both Apple Store and Google Play. Currently, we have finished the recording of our Hausa Audio Bible, which will be released in 2021. We are also looking forward to volunteers and sponsors, who will love to work with us on the Igbo Audio Bible and other Nigerian languages.

# How to contribute to DaBible Foundation
If you have suggestions about how we can improve our products, please suggest them by [Creating an Issue](https://github.com/sanmiayotunde/DaBible-Foundation/issues)


# How we work at DaBible Foundatin

## 1. Start with an issue
Here, everything starts with creating an issue to suggest a new idea or track a bug. Then we organize and assign the tasks to a team member. And don’t spare any attachments—issues support most image and file types. 

- [Start an Issue](https://github.com/sanmiayotunde/DaBible-Foundation/issues)
- [Learn the Basics of Issues](https://docs.github.com/articles/managing-your-work-with-issues/)


### Tasks
A submitted issue, comment, and pull request can have smaller components called a task. Task are lists—checklists you can use to coordinate and track parts of an issue. Reorder tasks as your priorities change, and check them off as you complete each one.

### Labels
Tagging issues and pull requests with labels allows you to quickly search for them later. Filter your issues by [label](https://docs.github.com/articles/applying-labels-to-issues-and-pull-requests/) to find and reference all issues that are part of your project.

Pro-tip: Templates help your team create issues without starting from scratch. [Learn how to set up an issue template](https://docs.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue-template-for-your-repository/)



### Assignees and mentions
Assign up to ten teammates to an issue or pull request to make sure work has an owner. Mentioning other people or teams in the issue will notify them if something changes. They can also stay in the loop by opting to [receive notifications](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-notifications/) whenever someone posts a comment.



### Milestones
Add a milestone to track a project as part of a larger goal, like a weekly, quarterly to-do list or a big feature. Then watch your milestone’s overall progress from [the milestone page](https://github.com/sanmiayotunde/DaBible-Foundation/milestones).

## 2. See your work take shape with Projects
Visualize all of your work and prioritize it right alongside your code with projects boards. See what tasks are planned or in-progress, either in a repository or across your organization.
