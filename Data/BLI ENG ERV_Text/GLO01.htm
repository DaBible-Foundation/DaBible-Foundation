Described as a sharing in the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ, it marked the beginning of their new life in Christ as part of God’s people.

This was done to every Jewish baby boy as a mark of the agreement God made with Abraham. Read Gen. 17:9-14. Sometimes “circumcision” is used with “heart” in the figurative sense of true devotion to God (see Jer. 9:26; Rom. 2:28). In the New Testament “circumcision” is also used in a spiritual sense to refer to the changed life of believers who have come to share in the new agreement God gave his people through Jesus.

He made plans and arrangements for the building of the first Temple in Jerusalem (“the city of David”), which was actually completed by his son Solomon.

Also called “Festival of Ingathering” (Ex. 23:16; 34:22).

The expression “Glory of the LORD” refers to one of the forms God used when he appeared to people. It was like a bright, shining light. In the book of Numbers, it might have been a bright light or a tall cloud. Sometimes glory means majesty or power, referring to a kind of greatness that cannot be compared to anything in human experience. It can also include the ideas of wealth, honor, fame, or respect, especially in expressions of praise. </div><div class='p'><span class='k'>God’s kingdom</span> The “reign” or “rule” of God over all people who accept Jesus as the Messiah (the chosen king). Jesus’ life and teachings show what it means for God to be King on earth. Jesus fulfilled the King’s mission of love and justice by setting people free from the control of the devil, the temporary ruler of this world. Through Jesus, God offers his enemies forgiveness for their rebellion against him. And when people are freed from their slavery to sin, they can give control of their lives to Jesus. Then they become part of God’s kingdom and gladly accept his mission. Just as Jesus did, they too invite God’s enemies to change their hearts and lives, become God’s friends, and enjoy the benefits of his just rule, both now and in the future. (Note that in Matthew this term also translates the Greek word “kingdom” by itself or the phrase, “the kingdom of the heavens,” which was used by Jews as a way to avoid saying the divine name.) </div><div class='p'><span class='k'>golden altar</span> The table made from acacia wood and covered with gold that was used in the Holy Tent for burning incense as a gift to God. </div><div class='p'><span class='k'>Gomorrah</span> A city that God destroyed, together with the city of Sodom, because the people living there were so evil.

In other places it is, more specifically, the news or message of God’s grace—that he has made a way through Jesus Christ for people to be made right with him and enjoy his blessings now and forever. </div><div class='p'><span class='k'>grace</span> The love and kindness that God shows in his complete willingness to give people favors he does not owe them and blessings they don’t deserve. </div><div class='p'><span class='k'>Greek</span> A non-Jewish person anywhere throughout the first century world who was influenced by Greek language and culture. </div><div class='s'>— H — </div><div class='p'><span class='k'>Hades</span> The Greek word for “Sheol,” the home of the dead.

Read Heb. 7:11–8:13. </div><div class='p'><span class='k'>holy</span> When referring to people or things, holy means set apart or chosen for a special use; especially, belonging to God or used only for him. It can also mean pure or perfect, worthy of God and fit for his service. When God is called holy, in addition to the idea of pure and perfect, it often means he is completely separate or different from and above everything else that exists. In the New Testament God’s people are holy because they have been made perfect and pure through Christ and, with the help of the Holy Spirit, keep themselves away from sin and live only for God. </div><div class='p'><span class='k'>holy people</span> Literally, “saints” or “holy ones,” a term used in the New Testament to describe followers of Jesus Christ as God’s special people.

Many prophets made it clear that this new kingdom would be eternal; that is, not only would the promised Messiah bring about a time of justice and right living among God’s people here on earth, but also his kingdom would extend beyond this world to life forever with God. However, most Jews of the first century expected the Messiah to be a political ruler here on earth who would defeat the other nations and return the nation of Israel to a position of great glory and power.
